Hey there, thanks for downloading the mod ^^
(I'm sorry for the huge amount of text, but it's kinda required to understand the mod's mechanics)

For this experience to be enjoyable, I recommand that you check out the base game (like watching a 'let's play' or actually playing it yourself), because the mechanic is HIGHLY based off the original game.

If you wanna play the game for yourself, you can get it here, it's pretty cheap for such an experience : https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846170/Iron_Lung/
If you to watch a let's play, I recommand you go watch Markiplier's here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPiCSsW-2as
If you're too lazy to do that, let me just give you these tips that might help you get through all the endings this mod has to offer (they're only 2, but whatever):

  - The photo mechanic in Iron Lung is pretty simple, since I cannot make you move the ship around the map (would have been cooler but idk how to do that, I'm too dumb),
you're only required to take the pictures at the right time. To explain, the markers on the map at the bottom left (when you open the new HUD) represents the place where you have to take pictures,
they will show you intresting pieces that remains deep down the blood of ocean. You must take ALL the required photographies to access the good ending. The last one is IMPOSSIBLE to reach, so it doesn't count.

  - The endings has a pretty intresting mechanic in the first song, because the game loads both endings at the same time when you play, its depending on the amount of pictures that you've taken that it changes what ending you shall get.
If you've launched Iron Lung from the main menu, finishing the first song will take you to the second one

  - The second song (if launched from the main menu) will load a different ending depending on the ending you got in the first one (this is not based off the original game, I just thought it was cool)
It's based off another game made by Lixian : Sinking Iron.

There, you should be good to go now...
HAVE FUN !
